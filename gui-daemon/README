There are two Makefiles. Makefile.stdin for communication over stdin/stdout,
Makefile.vchan over vchan. Use stdin version for easy debugging; vchan
version for final evaluation (it requires running Xen, and vchan
library).
In both cases, run vmside with DISPLAY set to xserver running over dummy
video driver, with no window manager running.
xside runs as normal application within any X environment.

1)  Makefile.stdin case 
First, on system A
socat tcp-listen:12346 system:./vmside

then, on possibly other system/xserver
socat tcp:ip_of_A:12346 system:"./xside 0"

2) Makefile.vchan case
In a Xen VM:
./vmside

In dom0
./xside id_of_the_domain
