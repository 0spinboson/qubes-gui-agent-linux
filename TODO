* sound virtualization

* Dom0 Window Manager integration: colorful frames around AppViewer windows 
-- make the Windows title bars to have VM's label color
-- this will be Desktop Environment-specific (e.g. KDE-specific)

* keyboard input driver (instead of X message injection)
-- unify with mouse virtualization
-- better apps support (e.g. xterm is currently broken)

* fix focus management when using e.g. with KDE Expose-like window changer
-- When an AppViewer window is picked via the Expose-like effect,
   the app in a AppVM doesn't get proper focus

* support for VM save/restore
-- need to handle event channel changes
-- detect 'migration' and restart qubes_gui[d]?

* Dom0 KDE integration: AppViewer Applet (e.g. for netvm tray display)
